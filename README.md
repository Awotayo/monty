# C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

# The Monty language

Welcome to the Monty Bytecode Interpreter. This interpreter was built in the C language and is compliant with ISO90, ISO99, & ISO11. It reads Monty bytecode files of any extension (preferably .m although it doesn't matter), and interprets the opcodes contained.

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
